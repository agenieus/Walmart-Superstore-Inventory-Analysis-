## Project Overview
This project involved a dataset containing data on the prices of different brands and models of smartwatches available in the market. The datasets give information about the smartwatches' specifications and how they affect the market price. This data analysis project aims to explore the various specifications of wristwatch brands and look at the more suitable brands in terms of functionality, health specifications, and cost-efficiency for buyers.

## Project Objectives
The data set contains 371 different smartwatch models with different specifications that influence the price of the smartwatches. The following are the insights to be derived from the analysis:


## Data Sources
The data was gotten from Kaggle. Data consisted of 380 rows and 13 columns; totals 4940 data entries of data about the top manufacturers of wristwatches worldwide; their watches and features relative to their prices.

## Data Cleaning, Preparation and Transformation
Cleaning and transformation of the data were performed in the Power BI query which included the following:

- Changing of data types
- Splitting of columns
- Creating conditional columns to create more measures
- Removing empty and duplicate rows
- Removing N/As
- Made sure the values are consistent within the column for better visualization

 

## Observations and Results

Findings

There are a total of 371 smartwatches in the dataset with 38 distinct brands, 133 distinct models of smartwatches, and 24 different display types of smartwatches. From the data, there are 344 GPS-enabled smartwatches and the average price of a smartwatch is $312.

Wear OS is the most used operating system by the smartwatches in this data totaling 38% of the total smartwatches. It is followed by Garmin OS which is used by 9% of the smartwatches.

AMOLED is the most common display type featured by the smartwatches in this data totaling up to 56% of the total smartwatches.

Despite that Wear OS is the most used operating system, Smartwatches with the Garmin Operating system is more expensive in terms of price compared to Wear OS. On average, a smartwatch with Garmin operating system costs $470.

Despite that AMOLED display type is used by 56% of the smartwatches and OLED display type is used by 4%, smartwatches with OLED display type are higher in price ($576) compared to AMOLED ($304).

The price of the smartwatches is not affected by the NFC feature. However, when compared with the GPS feature, the price of the smartwatch increases with or without NFC features, suggesting that GPS feature most likely increases the price of the smartwatch, unlike the NFC features.

Smartwatches with the cellular type of connectivity have higher price compared to those with the GPS connectivity. This suggests that cellular connectivity is preferred in a smartwatch.

The Maximum battery life of a wristwatch in the dataset is 72 days while the minimum is 1 day.

Findings

Smartwatch model Pro 3 has the maximum battery life of 72 days, followed by Enduro with 70 days, Galaxy Watch at 60 days, and Galaxy Watch 3 at 56 days

Access Brad, Access Gen 5, Access Runway, C2, Falster 2, Falster 3, and G-Shock GS all have a minimum battery life of 1 day.

The TAG Heuer smartwatch brand is the most expensive with the average price of $1,537 while Xiaomi smartwatch brand is the least expensive with the average price of $137 USD.
